            Nature is an inherent character or constitution,[1] particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws,
            elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at
            times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.[2]During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became
            the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.[3][4] With the Industrial Revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived
            from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine 
            providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.[2]

            Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the Solar System, it is
            third closest to the Sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar
            regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.[8] Precipitation varies widely with location, from 
            several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre.71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of 
            continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.
